*   Textbook information:
	We will be using
	[Compeau, P. and Pevsner, P., Bioinformatics Algorithms, An Active Learning Approach. Active Learning Publishers, La Jolla, CA, 2014.]({{ site.book_url }})

	This text book is accompanied by a set of video lectures that you
    can view in preparation for class discussion during class meeting times.
	[Video playlists are available on youtube]({{ site.book_videos_url }})

	**Class meeting times will (for the most part) not be lecture
      time**. The goal is to use class time to explore Biological and
      Algorithmic aspects of materials in depth and collaboratively
      with your peers.
	  
*  	Programming exercises and problems are integrated with the
	textbook readings and videos. We will use the
	[Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info) to manage programming
	exercises and submissions. [More information here]({{ site.baseurl }}/logistics.html) 
	
*   Other links:	
	We will use Piazza for official discussion and announcements:
