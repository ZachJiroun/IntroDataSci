	[H&eacute;ctor Corrada Bravo](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~hcorrada)  
	Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology  
	Department of Computer Science  
	<hcorrada@umiacs.umd.edu>  
	Office: 3114F Biomolecular Sciences Building  
	Phone Number: 301-405-2481 

*	Lecture Meeting times

	Office Hours: TBD  

*	Evaluation (see section below on logistics for details)

	*    Lecture prep work (15%): to be done before class, includes
         programming exercises and short written assignments. Graded
         as pass/fail.  
	*	 Written homework (15%): some will be take-home, some will be done
         in class.  
	*	 Programming Projects (25%)  
	*	 Midterms (2) (20%)  
	*	 Final exam (15%)  
	*	 Class participation (10%)  

*   Textbook information:
	We will be using
	[Compeau, P. and Pevsner, P., Bioinformatics Algorithms, An Active Learning Approach. Active Learning Publishers, La Jolla, CA, 2014.](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)

	This text book is accompanied by a set of video lectures that you
    can view in preparation for class discussion during class meeting times.
	[Video playlists are available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioinfalgorithms/playlists)

	**Class meeting times will (for the most part) not be lecture
      time**. The goal is to use class time to explore Biological and
      Algorithmic aspects of materials in depth and collaboratively
      with your peers.

	Supplementary course readings will be posted in canvas: [https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1088932](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1088932)  

####Expected outcomes and topics covered

At the end of this course, students will be able to describe,
implement and analyze algorithms that solve fundamental problems in
biological sequence analysis: sequence alignment and assembly, string
querying, sequence signal finding, and data clustering. They will also be able to identify and use appropriate publicly available resources, both data and tools, to perform common bioinformatics tasks. 

####Classroom Policies
* There will be reading assignments. Students are expected to have read the material **before** class. 
* Students are expected to attend lectures. Active participation is expected. There will be graded work done in class. 
* Assignments are to be handed-in electronically or in class as instructed on their due date. Late assignments will not be accepted.  
* There will be graded work to be done in class. Students not in class that day, except for an excused absence, will not be able to complete that work outside class.  
* Students may discuss homeworks and projects in groups. However, each
  student must write and/or program solutions independently.  
* Posting project solutions in a public online location without
  express consent and permission from the instructor is a violation of
  academic integrity policy.  
* Cell phone usage is **prohibited** during lecture, laptop use will be allowed to the extent that students **demonstrably** use it to follow along an in-class analysis or demonstration.  
* Using or referencing any materials from the web without proper citation is a violation to the honor code.   
* In this course you are responsible for both the [University's Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.jpo.umd.edu/) and the [University of Maryland Guidelines for Acceptable Use of Computing Resources](http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/). Any evidence of unacceptable use of computer accounts or unauthorized cooperation on tests, quizzes, or projects will be submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, suspension, or expulsion from the University. 
* Any student eligible for and requesting reasonable academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to provide, to the instructor in office hours, a letter of accommodation from the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) within the first two weeks of the semester. 
* Any student who must miss a class due to religious holidays should also notify the instructor during the first two weeks of class.  

#### Policy on excused absences ####

* Any student who needs to be excused for an absence from a single 
lecture, recitation, or lab due to a medically necessitated absence shall:
   a) Make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of his/her 
illness prior to the class.  
   b) Upon returning to the class, present their instructor with a 
self-signed note attesting to the date of their illness.  Each note must 
contain an acknowledgment by the student that the information provided 
is true and correct.  Providing false information to University 
officials is prohibited under Part 9(i) of the Code of Student Conduct 
(V-1.00(B) University of Maryland Code of Student Conduct) and may 
result in disciplinary action.  
* Self-documentation: The self-documentation may not be used for the
Major Scheduled Grading Events as defined below and it may only be
used for only 1 class meeting (or more, if you choose) during the
semester.  
* Any student who needs to be excused for a prolonged absence (2 or more consecutive class meetings), or for a Major Scheduled Grading Event, must provide written documentation of the illness from the Health Center or from an outside health care provider. This documentation must verify dates of treatment 
and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic 
responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name and phone number 
of the medical service provider to be used if verification is needed. No 
diagnostic information will ever be requested.
* The Major Scheduled Grading Events for this course include:
   a) Midterm #1 - October 15 during the lecture period
   b) Midterm #2 - November 12 during the lecture period

#### Course evaluations ####

Course evaluations are important and that the department and faculty
take student feedback seriously.  Students can go to the www.courseevalum.umd.edu to complete their evaluations.
