### Classification Analysis

Do Question 10 in Chapter 4 and Question 7 in Chapter 5 from
ISLR. These are on the `Weekly` dataset (also
included in the course Docker image), which you can load using

{% highlight r %}
library(ISLR)
data(Weekly)
{% endhighlight %}

You may want to do labs in Chapters 4 and 5 before answering these
questions.

Submit your answers (including both code and text as appropriate) as
an R markdown file (call it `prediction.Rmd`).
