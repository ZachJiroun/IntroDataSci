##Course Information

Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to
 create data-centric products and applicaitons that address specific
 scientific, socio-political or business questions.
 It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and
 is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism.

This course focuses on (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis,
(ii) data and information visualization, and (iii) the presentation
and communication of analysis results.
It will be heavily assignment-based and will draw extensively from applications
